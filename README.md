Press This ACF Mod extends the [Press This](https://wordpress.org/plugins/press-this/) plugin to support [Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) and custom taxonomies when creating or editing posts with press-this. This plugin injects ACF field groups and custom taxonomy panels into the Press This UI, emulating the native category/tag experience. All data is saved using WordPress core APIs for maximum compatibility.
